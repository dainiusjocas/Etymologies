  <h1>Etymologies</h1>
  <p><blockquote>Etymology is the study of the history of words, their origins, and how their form and meaning have changed over time. By an extension, the term "the etymology of [a word]" means the origin of the particular word. (Wikipedia)</blockquote></p>
  <p>This page is dedicated to document my toy project - Etymologies app for Android.</p>
  <p>The app is NOT kind of a dictionary. Etymology tells the story of the word. So, to learn a story about common objects in use -- words -- is just fun.</p>
  <p>The motivation behind this app is that sharp and easy to use tools are valuable. This app focuses only on searching and finding stories of words. Yeah, yeah, Google also might help you to find the origin of the word, but with a helicopter your not going to the supermarket buy yourself a bottle of milk.</p>
